# Biwhitening Implementation

Within this repository, you'll find an implementation of the algorithm presented in the paper titled [Biwhitening Reveals the Rank of a Count Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13840). The documentation references correspond to various sections within the mentioned paper.

## examples for the results
